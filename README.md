# MultipleDistributionInterpretation
This project is to implement a program that inputs a signal in the form of a multiple unknown distributions starting at unknown times.
The goal is to find the starting times for each distribution.
In the initial commit I used LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) to guess the times, then update them, and guess again, until the times converge.
